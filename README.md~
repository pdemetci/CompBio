# CompBio
Exploring computational biology while learning Java.
Projects include:
-- Open Reading Frame Finding ("ORF_Finder")
-- Pairwise/Multiple Alignment (through dynamic programming in "Alignment")
-- Gene Finder (through Hidden Markov Models. The states include: Introns, Intergenic States, Codons, StopCodons, StartCodons)
-- Genome Assembly (through de Bruijn Graphs) and Sequence Mapping (through Burrows-Wheeler Transform)
-- RNA Secondary Structure Prediction from RNA sequence & RNA Hybridization (using Viterbi Algorithm)
-- Gene Clustering (trying different methods: K-means & hierarchical & CAST clustering)
-- Gibbs & EM Motif Search in sequences

A work in progress
